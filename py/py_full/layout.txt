Okay, let's refactor the application to separate concerns further by moving routes into their own file using Flask Blueprints. This also requires moving shared components like the database instance, models, schemas, and auth logic into their own files to avoid circular imports.

Here's the new file structure:

your_project_directory/
├── app.py             # Main application factory and runner
├── config.py          # Configuration settings
├── extensions.py      # Flask extension instances (like db)
├── models.py          # SQLAlchemy models (Item)
├── schemas.py         # Marshmallow schemas
├── auth.py            # Authentication decorator (@require_api_key)
├── errors.py          # Error handlers (400, 401, 404, 500)
├── logging_config.py  # Logging setup function
├── routes.py          # Blueprint and route definitions for items
├── requirements.txt   # Project dependencies
├── app.log            # Log file (generated)
└── items.db           # Database file (generated)
